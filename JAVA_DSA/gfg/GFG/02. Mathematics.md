# Finding number of digits in a number

### `Iterative Solution` 

int countDigit[Long n]
{
	int count =0;
	while(n!=0)
		{
		n=n/10;
		++count;
		}
	return count;
}
***
### `Recursive solution`

int countDigit[long n]
{
	if(n==0)
	{
		return 0;
	}
	return 1+ countDigit[n/10];
}

***
### `Logarithmic Solution`

int countDigit[long n]
{
	return floor(log 10(n)+1);
}

# Arithmetic and Geometric Progressions
- ### Nth term in a Sequence
### 2,4,6,8,10 ...
first term = a = 2
difference = d = 2
Second term = a + d = 2+2 = 4
Third term = a + 2d = 2 + 4 = 6
.
.
.
**Nth term = a + (n-1) * d**
***
- ### Sum of N terms

-> **avg = sum/n**
-> **sum = avg x n**
-> **(First term + last term)/2 x N**
-> **n/2 x (a+a+(n-1)d)**
-> **n/2 x (2a+(n-1)d)**

# Geometric Progression

### 2,4,8,16,32 . . .
 first term = a = 2
 relation = r = 2
 second term = a.r = 4
 third term = ar<sup>2</sup> = 8
 **nth term = ar<sup>n-1</sup>**
 ***
 # Quadratic equations
 **ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c = 0**
 **D = b$^2$-4ac**   **X = -b +- $\sqrt{(b^2 - 4ac)} /2a$**
D<0, imaginary roots
D=0, two equal roots
D>0, two distinct roots
***
# Mean and Median
 **Mean**: The Mean is found by adding up all of thr given data and dividing b the number entries.
 **Eg**: (4+1+7)/3
 
 **Median**: The middle number; found by odering all data points and picking out the one in the middle (if 2 middle numbers find mean of those two numbers).
 **Eg**: 4,1,7
 (1,4,7) 4 is the middle value as median
 ****
 # Prime numbers
 
 every prime numbers can be represented in form of **6n-1** except 2 and 3, where n is the natural number.
